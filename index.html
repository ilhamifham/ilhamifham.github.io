    <h1>Hi There!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Ilham Ifham.</h2>
    <p>
      I am a software developer specialized in front-end development, transforming designs into functional and responsive user interfaces. My skill
      set includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I have developed several projects,
      which you can explore on my <a href="https://github.com/ilhamifham" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Feel free to connect with me on
      <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ilhamifham" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

    <p>
      I recently completed a remote internship at <a href="https://jadetimes.com" target="_blank">Jadetimes Media</a>, a news media company based in
      the New Mexico, United States. During my time there, I was actively involved in building the company’s website and content management system
      (CMS). This experience strengthened my front-end skills and sparked a growing interest in backend technologies, which I’m now eager to explore
      further as I work toward becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer. Although the internship has officially ended, I am currently continuing
      to contribute to their projects on a freelance basis, supporting ongoing improvements to their web platforms.

      Apart from programming, I have a deep passion for wildlife photography. Capturing the beauty of nature and its creatures brings me great joy
      alongside my tech work.
