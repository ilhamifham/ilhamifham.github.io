    <h1>Hi There!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Ilham Ifham.</h2>
    <p>
        I am a front-end developer currently expanding my skills in backend development. My expertise includes HTML,
        CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, SCSS,
        JavaScript, jQuery, TypeScript, React, and Next.js and I am based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I also have several
        personal projects showcased on my
        <a href="">GitHub</a> and you can visit me on <a href="">LinkedIn</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I’m working as a remote intern at <a href="">Jadetimes</a>, a news media company based in the USA,
        where I am involved in building
        the company’s website and CMS. As I continue to grow as a developer, I’m excited to dive deeper into backend
        technologies and further enhance my
        full-stack capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from programming, I have a deep passion for wildlife photography. Capturing the beauty of nature and its
        creatures brings me great joy alongside my tech work.
